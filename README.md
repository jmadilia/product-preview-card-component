## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I got more familiar with the mobile-first workflow utilizing Tailwind. Using it more and more is just reinforcing how simple it can make writing fast CSS, especially when it comes to media queries.

I created the component with Next.js in mind just to get more familiar with the process. This was overkill for the purpose of this component, but it was still good practice. Getting the hang of using Tailwind combined with the Next.js Image component took a bit to understand but was ultimately straight-forward.

### Continued development

The layout for the component is consistent, but I couldn't quite nail down the image sizing issue for mobile devices. Currently, the image scales with screen size on mobile devices. I had to cheat a bit and set a hardcoded height for the image, locking it in place.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tons of great, easy-to-follow, well-illustrated examples for visual learners.
- [Next.js Image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image)
